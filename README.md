# School District Analysis

# Purpose
A School district asked for an analysis of reading and math scores across the district broken down to include scoring as it relates to school type, budget per student, and enrollment size.  After reviewing the data, the school board was made aware of potential cheating in the 9th grade class of Thomas High School.  The data from this class was removed and the data was analyzed again for comparison.

As we can see, changing the 9th grade class' scores to NaN had a very small impact on the overall district scoring.
